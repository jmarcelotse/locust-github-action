Please see this branch as an example: https://github.com/apardo04/locust-github-action/tree/requirements-test
  1. Make sure your repo has a [requirements.txt](https://github.com/apardo04/locust-github-action/blob/requirements-test/test/requirements.txt) file.
  2. In your [workflows yml file](https://github.com/apardo04/locust-github-action/blob/requirements-test/.github/workflows/test.yml), use the REQUIREMENTS input and pass it the path to the file.
  3. Import the dependencies in your [locustfile.py](https://github.com/apardo04/locust-github-action/blob/requirements-test/locustfile.py)

### Using a specific version of locust
  1. Decalare a specific version in your requirements.txt file (See Installing 3rd party dependencies above)

  locust==2.5.1
  ```
### Passing Github Secrets to locustfile
Please see this branch as an example: https://github.com/apardo04/locust-github-action/tree/env-var-test
  1. Create a repository secret in Github.
  2. Assign it to an env variable (ex: 'GITHUB_USERNAME') in the workflows yml file: https://github.com/apardo04/locust-github-action/blob/env-var-test/.github/workflows/test.yml
  3. Reference the env variable in locustfile: https://github.com/apardo04/locust-github-action/blob/env-var-test/locustfile.py
